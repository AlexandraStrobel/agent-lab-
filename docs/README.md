# Environment setup

You have 3 options for environment setup, installation of APIs and using Notebooks. Please choose the one which suits you best.

1. [**Github CodeSpaces**](environment-setup-codespaces.md) - a purely cloud-based environment.  This should be your go-to option if you do NOT have a linux environment (OSX or WSL/Windows) or docker on your laptop/workstation.

2. [**Devcontainer & Docker-compose**](environment-setup-devcontainer.md) 

3. [**Poetry & python**](environment-setup-local-virtualenv) - for developers comfortable with the command line, pyenv and poetry. If you're on Windows, you must have & use WSL.

Remember, you only have to choose one of the paths above. 


## What you will have running

Regardless of the method you use (above) at the end you should have the ability to run [Jupyter notebooks](../agent-lab/notebooks/) for the Agent Lab.
